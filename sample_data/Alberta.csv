which includes all removal and placement of overburden and soils, in addition to the mining, crushing, screening and stockpiling of gravel in the following quantities and sizes:
40,000 m3 –Modified Specification 4:25 Gravel
at SW18-45-18-W4M","SPECIFICATIONS AND SPECIAL PROVISIONS

1.	Overburden removal, interburden removal, and finish contouring at Blatz Pit #2 located in lands legally described SW18-45-18-W4M will be incidental to the Services.  There will be no compensation expected of the County.

2.	For the purpose of this contract, Overburden and interburden removal shall include all excavation and placement of common material (including topsoil stripping and stockpiling, subsoil stripping and stockpiling, haul road earthworks, and waste material movement).

There is a minimal quantity of topsoil and subsoil stripping and stockpiling that shall be required over some areas of gravel extraction.  Test holes as shown in Schedule “F” is meant to show the extent of these quantities.  While some of these testholes reflect the current status of the pit, others were representative pre-disturbance and as such those soils have been removed.  All Overburden removal will be incidental to the Services.  All soil stockpile sites (as required) have been identified on Drawing Number GC-01-2019.  All soils stockpiles should be appropriately contoured to promote positive drainage away from the piles and allow for an accurate survey.  

The Contractor shall take care in maintaining the separation of “Topsoil” and “Subsoil” as determined by the Manager of Public Works or his designate.  Admixing will not be permitted and the occurrence of such will be subject to penalty as deemed appropriate by the Manager of Public Works or his designate.

It shall be the Contractor’s responsibility to ensure acceptance of the Overburden removal quantities required.

All Overburden removal shall be as per the current Code of Practice for Pits.

3.	The Contractor shall slope all embankments caused by excavations created while crushing gravel in the aforementioned gravel pits and prior to moving any equipment away from the pit.  The said embankments shall be sloped at no less than 3:1 or as otherwise specified by the Manager of Public Works or his designate. 

4.	The Contractor shall:

4.1.	Mine, crush, screen, measure and stockpile 40,000 cubic meters of 4:25 modified specification gravel at Blatz Pit #2 at SW18-45-18-W4M (Measured in place).

5.	The order of extraction of in-situ Gravel will be from the south-west corner, progressing to the east and north as referenced in the Gravel Extraction area as illustrated in Drawing Number GC-02-2019.  In-situ material will be transported by the Contractor to the crusher by whatever means deemed appropriate by the Contractor and as approved by the Manager of Public Works.

6.	In all locations of gravel extraction, the intent is that the gravel resource shall be removed to a depth in which there is no remaining gravel resource underlying the final excavation elevation.  It is required that a trackhoe be utilized to properly exhaust gravel resources to the final pit elevation.  County personnel will confirm acceptance that all gravel has been satisfactorily mined.  Pockets of interburden removal shall be considered incidental to the Services.

7.	It is the contractor’s responsibility to verify the quantities to his own satisfaction.

8.	It shall be mandatory that stacking conveyors be utilized for the final stockpiling of all crushed gravel.

Notice of Intent,Services,,"The City of Calgary (“The City”) is proceeding with the following acquisition:

Scope of Project:
The Push-to-Talk (PTT) service is a critical communication tool for The City and Calgary Parking Authority (CPA), which allows instant voice and work group communications with the push of a button. In late 2013, The City’s Information Technology (IT) Business Unit was notified by its then current PTT service provider they were decommissioning PTT services by the end of 2016. 

In response to the impending changes, The City collected information from the market through Request for Information (RFI) 14-038 requesting information on alternative solutions. Based on those responses, The City’s IT Business Unit determined that Bell Mobility (""Bell"") was the only solution able to fulfil the services requirements of The City. 

In late 2015, The City issued an NOI 15-055 advising of The City’s intent to enter into an Agreement with Bell Mobility. Following the NOI, The City and Bell entered an agreement to provide PTT services for 3 years.  

The PTT service continues to be a critical communication tool for multiple City business units, which includes first responders, and for CPA. Based on The City’s current knowledge of the options available in the market, The City concludes that Bell Mobility continues to be the only PTT service provider that can deliver the mandatory functionalities The City and CPA requires. The City knows of no other PTT service currently available in a full production environment with the ability to deliver the required business functionalities.

Notice is hereby given by The City of Calgary (“The City”) of its intent to enter a contract with Bell Mobility Inc. (“Bell”), for the provision of Push-To-Talk (“PTT”) service to support in excess of 1500 users and devices in The City and CPA.  

The procurement includes: 

1.	Monthly subscription on Push-To-Talk service and Voice or Data services as needed;
2.	Central Administration tool to manage group talking and end users;
3.	Dispatch console as required; and
4.	When required, cellular hardware and cellular accessories, any hardware and associated support services to provide Push-To-Talk service at different environments.

 The contract is required for 3 years from July 2019 to July 2022. The City and CPA estimate a combined cost of $2,000,000.00 excluding GST, based on approximately 1,500+ end users with PTT and Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) call function. 

It is the intent of The City to award this contract for the following reason(s):

1.	Under New West Partnership Trade Agreement (NWTPA) exemption (g) “where it can be demonstrated that only one supplier is able to meet the requirements of a procurement”, Bell has a proven PTT service;
2.	The Bell PTT solution has the capability to meet the mandatory requirements of The City which includes:
o	Must be capable to provide cellular voice and data service to end users;
o	The PTT service must be proven through current operation in a full production environment, not in any kind of testing or development phase;
o	Must support talk groups up to 250 active users;
o	Must provide direct technical support by the providers technicians:
o	The PTT solution must be integrated into the Carrier core network providing call priority service which is monitored, managed and maintained by the Carrier. 
o	Must have sub-second call set-up performance where it takes less than one second for a call to set up (the time it takes for the first volley) and maintains sub-second latency for users to volley back and forth;
o	Must have the capability to provide a central administration tool to allow The City IT and CPA IT to configure group talking and manage end users including segregation of talk groups for individual operational entities (e.g. Business Unit A must not be able to modify or view talk-group information for Business Unit B);
o	Must have a dispatch console that can be installed onto a computer located at The City and CPA or is available as a web based tool; and
o	Must conform to industry standards of the Open Mobile Alliance Push-To Talk on Cellular (OMA PoC) version 2.
For consideration any party that wishes to address this procurement action must submit in writing the following information:
5.	Firm name and contact information;
6.	Relevant specific information regarding the firm’s ability to address the specified procurement;
7.	Ability to offer competitive products and services that will be advantageous to The City ; and
8.	Brochures, marketing information and other non essential materials should NOT be included.

Information package must be submitted in English and need not be more than two (2) pages in length.

9.	Responses to the NOI must be submitted and electronically on the MERX portal located online at:
www.calgary.merx.com

10.	All responses to this NOI must be submitted on or before the Submission Deadline.  

Questions regarding this NOI must be submitted using the “Q & A Tab” in the MERX online system at the location cited above.

In this PQR, Proponents are to identify Service Categories that they want to qualify for and the respective Service Delivery Regions of the Ministry in which they want to qualify to provide those services.  A resource list of Qualified Service Providers will be generated following the evaluation of submissions, with evaluations beginning on or about the third Monday of each month.

The first open period of this PQR was January 4, 2016 to February 5, 2016, with the following supplementary open periods:
•	April 4, 2016 to April 15, 2016
•	September 26, 2016 to October 7, 2016

It has been identified through Environmental Scanning, Labour Market research and feedback from Medicine Hat, Brooks and Lethbridge Alberta Supports Income and Employment Service (ASIES) offices, that there has been an increase in the number of vulnerable Albertans who have multiple barriers to employment looking for employment support services. Many are chronically unemployed because of the nature of their barriers. These Albertans are in need of support and services that will provide them with the necessary assistance to help them prepare for, find and maintain employment.

Request for Proposal,Services,,"Alberta has one province-wide health authority: Alberta Health Services (AHS).  Health research, including clinical trials, in Alberta is conducted in AHS facilities or in designated clinic facilities provided by Alberta academic institutions.  All health research in Alberta that requires AHS resources requires approval by AHS.

The University of Alberta, the University of Calgary, and Alberta Health Services (with representation from the Cross Cancer Institute and the Tom Baker Cancer Centre), are the major stakeholders involved in the conduct of clinical trials in Alberta. These institutions have formed the Alberta CTMS Group.

There are more than 1,800 active trials in Alberta, and approximately 800 investigators and trial support staff. Conducting a trial requires strict regulatory compliance and adherence to complex protocol schedules. To meet these requirements, tracking and documentation tools are essential. With the current absence of a centralized system, researchers are using Excel spreadsheets, email and paper based processes to manage their clinical trial activities. These methods result in data entry duplication, lack of standardization, lack of notification ability, and lack of quality assurance. 

The adoption of a Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS) could:

• Improve patient safety, management and overall trial experience;
• Improve budgeting and financial management, invoicing, reconciliation and financial reporting;
• Facilitate provincial collaboration on clinical trials;
• Reduce the burden of administrative tasks associated with clinical trial activity;
• Support regulatory, billing and protocol compliance; and
• Help establish provincial standards for reporting and decision making.

The Alberta CTMS Group is seeking proposals from qualified vendors to supply, install, configure and support a CTMS. 

It is anticipated, that implementing one solution across the province shall lead to cost benefits derived from economies of scale most particularly in respect of implementation, maintenance and license fees.  It is expected the interface with the provincial Electronic Health Record (EHR) system (Epic) will be a benefit more quickly realized with a single provincial CTMS.",2019-07-10T17:00:00,Johnathan,Morrison,403-220-5613,403-282-8451,2019-05-29T14:21:54,2019-06-05T19:00:00,"University of Calgary

Alberta Community and Social Services (“Ministry”) works collaboratively with government, community, partners, and stakeholders to improve the quality of life for Albertans through delivery of respectful, adaptive supports and innovative, prevention-focused programs and policies. The Ministry strives to ensure that Albertans are supported – that they have the resources and skills to optimize their quality of life, that they are protected and safe in their homes and communities, and that they are enabled and empowered to be successful.

The purpose of this PQR is to develop Resource Lists of Qualified Service Providers for the Ministry’s future contracting services.

The Resource Lists may be used to call for proposals and/or to award contracts without further competition. A separate Request for Proposals (RFP) may be advertised for specialized services. In this PQR, Proponents are to identify Service Categories that they want to qualify for and the respective Service Delivery Regions of the Ministry in which they want to qualify to provide those services.  A resource list of Qualified Service Providers will be generated following the evaluation of submissions, with evaluations beginning on or about the third Monday of each month.

The first open period of this PQR was January 4, 2016 to February 5, 2016, with the following supplementary open periods:

A Qualified Service Providers (QSP) List will be generated following the evaluation of submissions.   The Qualified Service Providers List will remain in effect from January 4, 2018 to March 31, 2021. Child Care organizations eligible to bid to be on the Qualified Service Providers List include those delivering licensed Child Care Programs (CCP) and approved Family Day Home Agencies (FDHA).

Alberta Community and Social Services (“Ministry”) works collaboratively with government, community, partners, and stakeholders to improve the quality of life for Albertans through delivery of respectful, adaptive supports and innovative, prevention-focused programs and policies. The Ministry strives to ensure that Albertans are supported – that they have the resources and skills to optimize their quality of life, that they are protected and safe in their homes and communities, and that they are enabled and empowered to be successful.

The purpose of this PQR is to develop Resource Lists of Qualified Service Providers for the Ministry’s future contracting services.

The Resource Lists may be used to call for proposals and/or to award contracts without further competition. A separate Request for Proposals (RFP) may be advertised for specialized services. In this PQR, Proponents are to identify Service Categories that they want to qualify for and the respective Service Delivery Regions of the Ministry in which they want to qualify to provide those services.  A resource list of Qualified Service Providers will be generated following the evaluation of submissions, with evaluations beginning on or about the third Monday of each month.

The first open period of this PQR was January 4, 2016 to February 5, 2016, with the following supplementary open periods:
•	April 4, 2016 to April 15, 2016

Request for Standing Offer,Services,,"The City of Calgary (The City) is seeking up to three (3) consulting firms to
provide multi-disciplinary engineering consulting services to support the
operations and maintenance of The City’s existing drainage infrastructure as
part of implementing Local Drainage Improvement (LDI) projects to address
Local Drainage Issues.
The nature of capital work involves smaller scale stormwater system
infrastructure upgrades that address various service requests from citizens
(i.e. drainage notifications). The LDI projects are generated from issues
arising within the storm network, including overland flooding and damage to
private property. Tasks vary for each site and typically involve field
assesments, civil engineering analysis, engineering report and drawings,
approvals, tendering, and construction.
As LDI assignments arise, schedules and deliverables will be discussed with
the Elligible Consultant. It is expected that assignments may vary in
technical and time demands. Currently there are 14 active drainage issues,
carried forward from previous years, which are expected to be completed
within Q4 2019. Recent solutions have included earth berms, retaining walls,
new short pipe installation or upgrade, new catchbasins, new manholes,
regrading of roadways, pipe maintenance, road maintenance, weeping tile
installation, swale construction, and landscape work. The total average
spend on these LDI projects (including construction) is approximately $800K
total per year.
Each drainage project will vary in scope but may consist of the following
Phases, with each phase being subject to The City’s approval:
• Phase 1 Preliminary Design and Community and Stakeholder Engagement;
•Phase 2 Detailed Design and Preparation of Procurement Documents;
•Phase 3 Procurement Process and Construction Administration; and
•Phase 4 Post Construction Services and Project Closeout
Work will be assigned to the successful firms on a ROTATIONAL basis,
as defined in the SELECTION PROCESS (EVALUATION) section.
This RFSO is open to pre-qualified firms only. Proponents are invited who
have been pre-qualified based on specific information previously submitted
through The City’s Prequalification for Engineering and Architectural
Consultants RFPQ 06-006. Proposals will only be considered from
proponents that have achieved a pre-qualified status in the following
discipline(s):
• Linear Pipe Wastewater; or
•System Hydraulic Analysis; or
•Hydraulic Structures.
To view the list of pre-qualified firms, visit Calgary.ca and search for
“prequalification” –from the results select “Prequalification for Engineering
and Architectural Services.”
Each Master Agreement will have a term of three (3) years. The term of any
Service Level Agreement entered into under a Master Agreement will have a
term appropriate to the completion of the Requirements set out therein.

Alberta Children’s Services (“Ministry”) works collaboratively with government, community, partners, and stakeholders to improve the quality of life for Albertans through delivery of respectful, adaptive supports and innovative, prevention-focused programs and policies. The Ministry strives to ensure that Albertans are supported – that they have the resources and skills to optimize their quality of life, that they are protected and safe in their homes and communities, and that they are enabled and empowered to be successful.

The purpose of this PQR is to develop Resource Lists of Qualified Service Providers for the Ministry’s future contracting services.

The Resource Lists may be used to call for proposals and/or to award contracts without further competition. A separate Request for Proposals (RFP) may be advertised for specialized services. In this PQR, Proponents are to identify Service Categories that they want to qualify for and the respective Service Delivery Regions of the Ministry in which they want to qualify to provide those services.  A resource list of Qualified Service Providers will be generated following the evaluation of submissions, with evaluations beginning on or about the third Monday of each month.

The first open period of this PQR was January 4, 2016 to February 5, 2016, with the following supplementary open periods:
•	April 4, 2016 to April 15, 2016
•	September 26, 2016 to October 7, 2016

Request for Proposal,Services,,"The City of St. Albert (hereinafter referred to as the ‘City’) is requesting proposals from qualified, licensed professional consulting engineering firms to provide engineering design, stakeholder engagement and land acquisition services for the Northeast Storm Sewer Trunk and Outfall. The purpose of this project includes investigating and designing a stormwater transmission method through a best-fit utility corridor including an outfall into the Sturgeon River. 
The planning for this sustainable piece of infrastructure supports multiple developments within the north east and proactively plans for the management and conveyance of collected stormwater. Effectively conveying collected stormwater into the Sturgeon River will facilitate the long-term environmental sustainability of the river valley and watershed.
The City is looking for a comprehensive and holistic solution that incorporates best practices and mitigates environmental impacts with the overall goal of designing a system that optimizes operations and the long-term hydraulics of the system. 
The successful proponent will be responsible to provide a viable and cost-effective design (taking into consideration alignment restrictions, overall pipe length, geotechnical constraints, hydraulic constraints, operational ease and access, etc.), lead in land acquisition along the proposed right-of-way, facilitate open-houses showcasing the project scope, engage with stakeholders, and provide project management.
See attached map “NE Area Storm – Outfall to Sturgeon River” in Schedule ‘C’ showing required tie-in location to the exiting 1200mm storm stub within City boundary. Storm sewer alignment to follow a path of most suitable hydraulic transmission to outfall into the Sturgeon River to the east while minimizing land acquisition and construction costs, ensuring ease of operation and maintenance, minimizing transmission route length, consideration of environmental impact and low-impact design, and considering the substantial hydraulics of the proposed system.
Please note that in advance of any annexation decisions between Sturgeon County and the City of St. Albert, any design and ROW alignment currently located within Sturgeon County, will require the approval of Sturgeon County. As this project is intended to address drainage in areas that adjoin two municipalities, the City of St. Albert will take the lead role in delivery with the intention that this project will require joint endorsement by both Sturgeon County and the City. The City and consultant will actively continue to ensure that Sturgeon Count is engaged throughout the entirety of the project, from RFP endorsement to conceptual and detailed design completion.",2019-07-18T20:00:00,Aleks,Cieply,(780)459-1660,780-458-1974,2019-06-27T21:35:16,2019-06-27T21:45:21,,NE Area Storm -  Sturgeon River Outfall (Project 5),Alberta,Open,NWPTA/TILMA & CFTA & CETA & WTO GPA,Open & Competitive,,Alberta,APC,,http://vendor.purchasingconnection.ca/Opportunity.aspx?Guid=8090443E-5650-455F-9ACD-EE0F0B6CADAC,"5133D Sewers/ Drainage  B219A Other Engineering Studies  C219A Engineering Services  C219B Engineering Services, N.E.S.

The Town of Olds has adopted the great horned owl as it mascot, Oliver Olds is all over Olds.
The Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) is Alberta’s Provincial Bird. Great Horned Owls reside all year long in Alberta and are common throughout Alberta. It is readily identified by its large size and prominent ""horns"" pointed toward the sides of the head. The neck and back are light brown speckled, streaked and barred with black and white. The undersides are light in color and heavily barred, accentuating the white throat. These owls are very stealthy. Their feathers offer camouflaging to the surrounding treed habitat and they are nearly silent when in flight. All great horned owls have a facial disc. This can be reddish, brown, or gray in color (depending on geographical and racial variation) and is demarked by a dark rim culminating in bold, blackish side brackets.
